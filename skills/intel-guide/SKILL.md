Use when someone asks how the intelligence workspace works, how to get started with the Intel connector, what it can and cannot answer, or which intel skill to use. Not for answering the question itself (intel-ask) or for building a document (intel-brief)."

# Intel guide: your engagement's intelligence workspace (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-intel` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-intel` MCP with `path="skills/intel-guide/SKILL.md"`.

   **Read it to the end.** `fs_read` returns one page at a time. If the result's `next_offset_chars` is not null — or the returned text ends in a `<<< PARTIAL READ … >>>` block — the body is incomplete: call `fs_read` again with `offset_chars` set to that value and concatenate, repeating until it comes back null. Do **not** start work on a partial skill body. Hard rules and anti-patterns often sit in the final third, and a partial read fails silently — it looks like a complete skill.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/intel-guide"` (and `path="skills/intel-guide/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/intel-guide/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-intel` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
